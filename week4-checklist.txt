We only have 2hrs testing time in week 4, so we need to use the time efficiently.

(1) Verify if the 'fixed code' works or not.

If it does not work:
  - Comment out the 'off the line' section to check the rotating parts
  - Check the speed constants
  - Check the rotating left & right time and interval

After this, the result should be back to the original (goes off the line often but works) solution.

(2) Start increasing the speed of the robot.
Remember:
  - When the speed increases, the time that the robot rotates should decrease.

(3) Remember to take video and document after any major change.

(4) See if we can add the IR Controller functionality to our final code.
