__Notes For Myself__

In the future, use Github version control for all code modifications in the lab.

All commits MUST have a description for what changed/what worked.


__Notes For Pagabio__

When you have time, please upload the notes/records that you took to the repository using the 'Add a File' button.

The quality of the notes isn't important, I just need the notes for a better idea of what went wrong.
